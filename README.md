# Pathfindr

*Pathfinder*, or _Pathfindr_ as the kids spell it, is an alternative way to find the right course for you at TAFE SA.

*Pathfinder* replaces _search_ with _seek_. At TCS we believe in choice, and with *Pathfinder* we add the ability to _browse_ for the course that matches you.

By answering a series of questions we narrow down the list of courses provided by TAFE SA from over a thousand, to a manageable number to browse.
